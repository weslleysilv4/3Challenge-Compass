## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project includes the following key features:

- **Front-end Development:** The user interface was developed using React with TypeScript, focusing on a clean and intuitive design. TailwindCSS was used for styling to ensure a responsive and modern look.
- **Back-end Development:** The backend was structured using Node.js with the Express framework, ensuring efficient handling of API requests and database operations. Prisma was used as an ORM for database management, providing a seamless interface with the SQLite database.
- **Database Management:** The project uses SQLite with Prisma ORM to handle all database operations, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying. The database schema includes models for Users, Tours, Countries, Categories, Reviews, and Ratings, reflecting a comprehensive system for managing tour-related data.
- **API Integration:** The system integrates with various APIs, such as the WeatherAPI, to provide real-time weather information for each tour destination.
- **Testing and Optimization:** Extensive testing was performed to ensure the system works efficiently across different environments and meets all specified requirements. The code was optimized for performance and maintainability.
